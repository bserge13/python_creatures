# Functions are the ruby equivalent to class/methods?

# def greetings_function(name, age):
#     # indentation must be four spaces/two tabs

#     print('Welcome '+name+'. You are '+str(age)+' years old.')
    
#     # print('Wlecome '+names[1])
#     # *names == passing in various ammounts; an unknown potential number of arguments to accept 
    
#     # print('Welcome '+name+ '. You are '+str(age)+' years old.')
#     # this becomes dynamic taking in arguments when the function is being called
#     # have to turn the integer into a string to be able to concatinate 

# # greetings_function('Fair', 'Tim', 'Benny')
# # greetings_function('John', 18)
# name = input('Enter your name: ')
# age = input('Enter your age: ')
# # this will turn the user input into dynamic variables for the function call (method)  
# greetings_function(name, age)
# this is calling the function/method

# def square_footage(length, width):
#         sqf = str(length * width)
#         print(sqf + " square feet") 

# square_footage(4,7)
