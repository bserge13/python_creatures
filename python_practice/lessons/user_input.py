name = input('Input Your Name: ')
# age = input('Input Your Age: ')- input by itself will be a string value 
age = int(input('Input Your Age: ')) 
print('Your name is ' + name + ' and you are ', age , ' years old.') 

# the syntax input takes in user input as the value for a variable we want to work with. 
# Input also takes a perenthesis that can be printed to tell a user what they need to input. 
# Ex: team = input('What is your favorite sports team?: '), now the variable team will hold the user input 

# REMEMBER- if working with an integer and doing concatination you MUST use commas vs plus signs for integers to print
